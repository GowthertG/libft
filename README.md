## What is libft?
[Libft][1] is an individual project at [42][2] that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

Disclaimer: *Reinventing the wheel is bad, 42 makes us do this just so we can have a deeper understanding of data structures and basic algorithms. At 42 we're not allowed to use some standard libraries on our projects, so we have to keep growing this library with our own functions as we go farther in the program.*

## What is in it?

According to [project's pdf][1] there should be 4 sections:

1.  **Libc Functions:** Some of the standard C functions.
2.  **Additional functions:** Functions 42 deems will be useful for later projects.
3.  **Bonus Functions:** Functions 42 deems will be useful for linked list manipulation.
4.  **Personal Functions:** Functions I believe will be useful later.

# Notes:

- Most of the the files and function names are namespaced with an **ft** in front. It stands for Forty Two
- The project instructions require that we put all the source files in the root directory but for the sake of this Github repo, I separate them into sub folders according to classification above.
- I update this list almost every month with new personal functions. If you don't know what a function does, refer to the [Wiki][mock], where I document all my personal functions.
